----------------- ASSIGNMENT BY IOANNA TALASLI FOR NODE.JS WEEK 2 IN SHA 05/2018 ---------------------

--- This is a Plain Text file with additional information, that will help anyone understand and run my application. 
At this point in time (05/2018) of creating my application, I am using the latest stable version of 
Node.js v8.11.1 LTS ---


-------------------------- Write a Node.js command line application ----------------------------------
----- The following commands must be present -----
1) The user must be able to run the file using node index.js 
2) No command or help ---> to display the available commands ----> node index.js . or node index.js help
3) list ---> Shows current to-dos, or shows an appropriate text if there are no to-dos --> node index.js list
4) add ---> Adds a to-do item. All the words behind add are entered as 1 to-do item to the list ---> ex. node index.js add item 1 
5) remove ---> Removes a to-do item by its 1-base index, e.g. to remove second item, execute ---> node index.js remove 2 
6) reset ---> Removes all to-do items from the list ---> node index.js reset
----------------------------------------- Bonus assignment -------------------------------------------
1) Use JSON to store to-dos
2) update ---> Updates a to-do item with new text ----> node index.js update 3 "Brush teeth"
3) Handle edge cases, i.e. control what happens if user enters unexpected input, e.g. remove -100

--- Notes to help you check that my application in index.js meets the above criteria and runs properly ---

1) Run in node my application from index.js in your terminal
2) Use the above commands to create your own todo list read my instructions on how to run it properly
3) Edge cases are handled and you will see warnings in the terminal if your input is invalid
4) There are no additional dependencies added to my application
5) The todo items will be added in the external file data.txt in Json. You can find it inside my folder NODE.JS-homeworkWeek2


----- Thank you for taking time to check out my second application using node.js. 
Any constructive feedback on my work, would be greatly appreciated. -----
