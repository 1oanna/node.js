---- Assignment by Ioanna Talasli for Node.js week 1 at SHA 04/2018 ----

--- This is a Plain Text file with additional information, that will help anyone understand and run my application. At this point in time (04/2018) of creating my application, I am using the latest stable version of Node.js v8.11.1 LTS and the latest version of Google Chrome 66.0.3359.117 ---

--- What I needed to do ---
Create an HTTP server that can add and subtract from a number, which we will call state.

--- Rules for the assignment ---
Rule 1
DO NOT USE EXPRESS.JS

Rule 2
Make a version without any npm packages. 
http, of course, is a built-in Node.js package, so you can use that.


--- Notes to help you check that my application in index.js meets the endpoint criteria and runs properly ---

1) Run in node my application from index.js in your terminal. 

2) You need to copy and paste each of those addresses below ex. http://localhost:8080/state in the browser. By doing that, you can see the results in the browser and check that my application is working correctly, as it supposed to from the given assignment by SHA. 

--- Endpoints criteria ---

// The state variable
let state = 10;

/* /state
 * response: the current state in a HTML format
 * When the server starts, this should return '10'
 */
http://localhost:8080/state


/* /add
 * Response: 11 in HTML format
 * This should add 1 to the current state
 */
http://localhost:8080/add

/* /subtract
 * Response: 10 in HTML format
 * This should subtract 1 Æ’rom the current state
 */
http://localhost:8080/subtract

/* /reset
 * Response: "OK" in HTML format
 * This should set the state back to '10'
 */
http://localhost:8080/reset

/* Any other URL
 * Response: return error code 404: 'Not found' with a friendly message and do
 * not change the state variable
 */
http://localhost:8080/bad
